    "# 🖼️ The Meaning of Area in a Probability Density Function (PDF)\n",
    "\n",
    "In a **PDF**, the y-axis represents **Probability Density**, not probability itself. To find actual probability, we must calculate the **Area** under the curve.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. The Core Rules\n",
    "1. **The Height is not Probability:** While the y-axis shows \"density,\" the height at a single point does not give you the chance of that value occurring.\n",
    "2. **Total Area = 1:** The area under the entire curve must always equal **1**, representing a 100% total probability.\n",
    "3. **Partial Area = Specific Probability:** The area between two points $a$ and $b$ represents the probability that the random variable $X$ falls within that interval: \n",
    "   $$P(a \\le X \\le b)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Why do we use Area?\n",
    "In a continuous distribution (like measuring time, weight, or height), the probability of hitting an **exact** single point (e.g., exactly $1.750000...$ meters) is technically **zero**. \n",
    "\n",
    "Because we cannot measure points, we measure **\"slices\"** (intervals). \n",
    "* A **wider slice** contains more area and represents a **higher probability**.\n",
    "* A **narrower slice** contains less area and represents a **lower probability**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Practical Example: Uniform Distribution\n",
    "Imagine a random variable $X$ that can be any value between **0 and 4**.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **The Width:** 4 units.\n",
    "* **The Height (Density):** To ensure the total area is 1, the height must be $1/4 = 0.25$.\n",
    "  * $\\text{Total Area} = 4 \\times 0.25 = 1$.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",

    "**Scenario:** What is the probability that $X$ is between **1 and 3**?\n",

    "2. **Calculate the Area:** $\\text{Width} \\times \\text{Height} = 2 \\times 0.25 = 0.5$.\n",

    "# 📈 How a Probability Density Function (PDF) Graph is Calculated\n",
    "\n",
    "A PDF graph is not a plot of raw counts; it is a calculated \"density.\" There are two primary ways to calculate the values for the y-axis: **Empirically** (using your data) or **Theoretically** (using a formula).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Empirical Calculation (Kernel Density Estimation - KDE)\n",
    "When you ask software (like Seaborn or Scipy) to plot a \"Density Plot\" for your data, it uses a process called **Kernel Density Estimation**.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Place a Kernel:** The algorithm places a small \"kernel\" function (usually a tiny Gaussian/Bell curve) over every single data point in the set.\n",
    "2. **Summation:** It sums the heights of all these individual tiny curves at every point along the x-axis.\n",
    "3. **Normalization:** The final curve is scaled so that the **total area under the curve equals 1**.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Normalized Histogram Method\n",
    "A PDF can be thought of as a smoothed, normalized histogram. The height (density) of each bar is calculated as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\text{Density} = \\frac{\\text{Count in Bin}}{\\text{Total Samples} \\times \\text{Bin Width}}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "* This calculation ensures that the units on the y-axis represent **Probability per Unit of X**, and that all bars combined have an area of 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Theoretical Calculation (Fitting a Model)\n",
    "If you assume your data follows a specific distribution (like a Normal Distribution), you calculate the graph points using a fixed mathematical formula.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 1:** Calculate the data's **Mean ($\\mu$)** and **Standard Deviation ($\\sigma$)**.\n",
    "**Step 2:** Plug every $x$ value into the Probability Density Function formula:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$f(x) = \\frac{1}{\\sigma\\sqrt{2\\pi}} e^{-\\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\frac{x-\\mu}{\\sigma}\\right)^2}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "*The result $f(x)$ provides the exact height of the curve at any point $x$.*\n",
