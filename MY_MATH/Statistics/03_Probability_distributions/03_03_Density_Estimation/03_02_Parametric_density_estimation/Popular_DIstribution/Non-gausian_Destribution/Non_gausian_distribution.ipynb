    "# 🌀 Non-Gaussian Distributions\n",
    "\n",
    "In Data Science, \"Non-Gaussian\" refers to any distribution that violates the symmetry or tail-behavior of the Normal distribution. Understanding these is crucial because applying \"Normal\" logic to \"Non-Normal\" data leads to incorrect conclusions.\n",

    "### 1. Common Types of Non-Gaussian Distributions\n",
    "\n",
    "#### A. Power Law / Pareto Distribution (The \"80/20\" Rule)\n",
    "In this distribution, a few extreme values (the \"long tail\") account for most of the total. \n",
    "* **Characteristics:** Extremely right-skewed; many small values and very few massive values.\n",
    "* **Examples:** Wealth distribution, city populations, word frequency in a language.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### B. Uniform Distribution\n",
    "Every value in the range is equally likely to occur. It looks like a flat rectangle rather than a bell.\n",
    "* **Characteristics:** No peak (mode); constant probability.\n",
    "* **Examples:** Rolling a fair die, spinning a roulette wheel.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### C. Bimodal / Multimodal Distributions\n",
    "Instead of one central peak, the data has two or more \"humps.\"\n",
    "* **Characteristics:** Suggests that the dataset is actually made of two different groups mixed together.\n",
    "* **Examples:** Human heights (if you don't separate by gender), peak traffic hours (morning vs. evening).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### D. Poisson Distribution\n",
    "Used for counting how many times an event occurs in a fixed interval of time or space.\n",
    "* **Examples:** Number of emails received per hour, number of customers arriving at a store.\n",

    "### 2. Key Differences: Gaussian vs. Non-Gaussian\n",
    "\n",
    "| Property | Gaussian (Normal) | Non-Gaussian (General) |\n",
    "| :--- | :--- | :--- |\n",
    "| **Symmetry** | Always Symmetric. | Often Skewed (Positive or Negative). |\n",
    "| **Outliers** | Very rare (defined by $3\\sigma$). | Can be frequent (Heavy tails). |\n",
    "| **Central Tendency** | Mean = Median = Mode. | Mean, Median, and Mode are different. |\n",
    "| **Predictability** | High (Empirical Rule applies). | Varies (Requires different formulas). |\n",

    "\n",
    "### 3. Dealing with Non-Gaussian Data in Data Science\n",
    "\n",
    "When we encounter Non-Gaussian data, we have three main strategies:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Non-Parametric Estimation:** Use methods like **Kernel Density Estimation (KDE)** which don't assume any specific shape.\n",
    "2. **Transformation:** Force the data into a Gaussian shape using:\n",
    "   * **Log Transform:** Compresses the long tail of a Pareto/Power Law distribution.\n",
    "   * **Box-Cox or Yeo-Johnson:** Mathematical \"stretching\" of the data.\n",
    "3. **Robust Statistics:** Use the **Median** instead of the Mean, as the Mean is too easily \"pulled\" by the heavy tails of Non-Gaussian data.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. How to Detect Non-Gaussian Data\n",
    "* **Visual Inspection:** Use Histograms or KDE plots.\n",
    "* **Q-Q Plots:** If the data points deviate from the straight 45-degree line, the data is Non-Gaussian.\n",
    "* **Statistical Tests:** Shapiro-Wilk Test or D'Agostino's K-squared test.\n"
