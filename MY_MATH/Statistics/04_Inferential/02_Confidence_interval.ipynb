    "# Confidence Intervals (CI)\n",
    "\n",
    "A **Confidence Interval** is a range of values, derived from sample statistics, that is likely to contain the value of an unknown population parameter. While a Point Estimate gives you a single value, a Confidence Interval expresses the **uncertainty** of that estimate.\n",

    "\n",
    "## 1. The Mathematical Formula\n",
    "For a population mean ($\\mu$), the confidence interval is calculated as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$CI = \\bar{x} \\pm \\text{Margin of Error}$$\n",
    "$$CI = \\bar{x} \\pm \\left( Z^* \\times \\frac{\\sigma}{\\sqrt{n}} \\right)$$\n",

    "It does **NOT** mean there is a 95% probability that the population mean lies within your specific interval.\n",
    "\n",
    "It **DOES** mean that if you were to take 100 different samples and compute a confidence interval for each, approximately 95 of those intervals would contain the true population mean.\n",

    "* **A/B Testing:** Deciding if the uplift in conversion rate is large enough that the confidence intervals of the Control and Treatment groups do not overlap.\n",
