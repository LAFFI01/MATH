    "    * *Example: \"The new website design increases sales.\"*\n",
    "\n",
    "### B. The P-Value\n",
    "The **P-value** is the probability of seeing a result as extreme as yours (or more extreme) if the Null Hypothesis were true.\n",
    "* **Small P-value ($\\le 0.05$):** The result is unlikely to be luck; we reject $H_0$.\n",
