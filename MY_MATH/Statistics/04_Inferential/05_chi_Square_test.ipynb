    "# Understanding the Chi-Square Test ($\\chi^2$)\n",
    "\n",
    "The Chi-Square test is used when you are dealing with labels or categories (e.g., Gender, Color, Location, Choice) rather than continuous numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Types of Chi-Square Tests\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two primary versions used in data science:\n",
    "\n",
    "### A. Goodness of Fit Test\n",
    "Determines if a sample data matches a population with a specific distribution.\n",
    "* **Example:** Testing if a six-sided die is fair (does each number come up 1/6th of the time?).\n",
    "* **Hypothesis:** $H_0$: The data follows the expected distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### B. Test of Independence\n",
    "Determines if there is a significant relationship between two categorical variables from the same population.\n",
    "* **Example:** Is there a relationship between \"Gender\" and \"Streaming Service Preference\"? \n",
    "* **Hypothesis:** $H_0$: The two variables are independent (no relationship).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. How it Works (The Formula)\n",
    "The test compares **Observed** counts ($O$) to **Expected** counts ($E$)—which is what we would expect to see if the Null Hypothesis were true.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\chi^2 = \\sum \\frac{(O_i - E_i)^2}{E_i}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Small $\\chi^2$:** Observed and Expected values are very close (No relationship).\n",
    "* **Large $\\chi^2$:** Observed and Expected values are very different (Significant relationship).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. Assumptions for Chi-Square\n",
    "1. **Categorical Data:** The variables must be nominal or ordinal.\n",
    "2. **Independence:** Each observation must be independent of others.\n",
    "3. **Large Sample Size:** Every \"cell\" in your table should have an expected frequency of at least **5**. If your counts are too small, the test becomes unreliable.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",

    "Using `scipy.stats.chi2_contingency` to check if \"Department\" affects \"Job Satisfaction.\"\n"
