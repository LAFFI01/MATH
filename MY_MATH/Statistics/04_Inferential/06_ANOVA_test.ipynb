    "# Understanding ANOVA (Analysis of Variance)\n",
    "\n",
    "ANOVA tests the Null Hypothesis that all group means are equal. If the test returns a significant result, it means at least one group is different from the others.\n",

    "## 1. Why not just run multiple T-tests?\n",
    "If you have 4 groups and run multiple T-tests to compare them all, your **Cumulative Type I Error** increases. \n",
    "* Running 6 T-tests at a 5% significance level gives you a ~26% chance of finding a \"fake\" significant result. \n",
    "* **ANOVA** solves this by performing one single \"Omnibus\" test at the 5% level.\n",

    "## 2. How ANOVA Works: The F-Statistic\n",
    "ANOVA doesn't look at means directly; it looks at **Variability**. It calculates the **F-ratio**:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$F = \\frac{\\text{Variance BETWEEN groups}}{\\text{Variance WITHIN groups}}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Between-group variance:** How much the group means differ from the overall average (The \"Signal\").\n",
    "* **Within-group variance:** How much individual data points spread out inside their own groups (The \"Noise\").\n",
    "* **Large F-value:** The signal is much stronger than the noise $\\rightarrow$ **Reject $H_0$.**\n",

    "One independent variable with 3+ levels.\n",
    "* **Example:** Comparing the weight loss of participants on 3 different diets (Keto, Vegan, Paleo).\n",

    "### B. Two-Way ANOVA\n",
    "Two independent variables.\n",

    "## 4. Key Assumptions\n",
    "1. **Normality:** Each group's data should be roughly normally distributed.\n",
    "2. **Homogeneity of Variance:** The spread (variance) should be similar across all groups.\n",
    "3. **Independence:** Observations in one group are independent of others.\n",
