    "# Inferential Statistics\n",
    "\n",
    "**Inferential Statistics** uses a random sample of data taken from a population to describe and make inferences about the population. While *Descriptive Statistics* summarizes the data you have, *Inferential Statistics* helps you reach conclusions about data you don't have.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Core Concepts & Formulas\n",
    "\n",
    "### A. Point Estimation\n",
    "Using a single value (like the sample mean $\\bar{x}$) to estimate a population parameter ($\\mu$).\n",
    "$$\\hat{\\mu} = \\bar{x}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "### B. Confidence Intervals (CI)\n",
    "A range of values used to estimate a population parameter with a specific level of confidence (usually 95%).\n",
    "$$CI = \\bar{x} \\pm (Z^* \\times \\frac{\\sigma}{\\sqrt{n}})$$\n",
    "* $Z^*$: Critical value (e.g., 1.96 for 95% confidence).\n",
    "* $\\frac{\\sigma}{\\sqrt{n}}$: Standard Error.\n",
    "\n",
    "### C. Hypothesis Testing\n",
    "A formal process for determining if a result is statistically significant.\n",
    "* **Null Hypothesis ($H_0$):** The assumption of \"no effect\" or \"no difference.\"\n",
    "* **Alternative Hypothesis ($H_a$):** What you want to prove (there is an effect).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. The Process: How to Perform Inference\n",
    "1. **Define the Population:** The group you want to study (e.g., all users of an app).\n",
    "2. **Collect a Sample:** A representative subset (e.g., 500 random users).\n",
    "3. **Calculate Statistics:** Find the mean, standard deviation, and standard error of the sample.\n",
    "4. **Apply a Test:** Use a Z-test, T-test, or ANOVA to find the **P-value**.\n",
    "5. **Draw a Conclusion:** If P-value < $\\alpha$ (usually 0.05), reject the Null Hypothesis.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. Data Science & ML Use Cases\n",
    "* **Model Comparison:** Testing if Model A is significantly better than Model B using a paired T-test.\n",
    "* **Feature Importance:** Using P-values to decide which features (variables) actually impact the target variable in a Regression model.\n",
    "* **A/B Testing:** Determining if a change in a website's UI led to a statistically significant increase in sales.\n",
    "* **Survey Analysis:** Predicting the behavior of millions of customers based on feedback from a few thousand.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4. Python Implementation: Hypothesis Testing\n",
    "This code performs a **One-Sample T-test** to see if a sample mean significantly differs from a known population mean.\n",
