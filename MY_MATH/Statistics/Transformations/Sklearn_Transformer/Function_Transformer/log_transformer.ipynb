    "# 🪵 The Log Transformer ($y = \\log(x)$)\n",
    "\n",
    "The Log Transformation is a mathematical operation used to replace each variable $x$ with $\\log(x)$. It is particularly effective for data that grows exponentially or follows a **Log-Normal** distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. How it Works: \"The Great Equalizer\"\n",
    "The log function has a unique property: it is \"stretched\" for small values and \"compressed\" for large values.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Small Values (0.1 to 10):** The log function spreads these out significantly.\n",
    "* **Large Values (1,000 to 10,000):** The log function pulls these closer together.\n",
    "* **Result:** A long right tail is \"tucked in,\" and the distribution becomes more symmetrical (Gaussian-like).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Why Use the Log Transformer?\n",
    "\n",
    "| Reason | Explanation |\n",
    "| :--- | :--- |\n",
    "| **Fixes Skewness** | Converts a right-skewed (log-normal) distribution into a normal distribution. |\n",
    "| **Linearizes Relationships** | Turns exponential growth ($y = e^x$) into a linear relationship ($y = x$), which Linear Regression can then model. |\n",
    "| **Stabilizes Variance** | Reduces \"Homoscedasticity\" issues where the error spread increases with the magnitude of the data. |\n",
    "| **Multiplicative to Additive** | In logs, multiplication becomes addition: $\\log(A \\times B) = \\log(A) + \\log(B)$. This helps in modeling economic factors. |\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. The \"Zero Problem\" and the Log1p Fix\n",
    "The standard natural log $\\ln(x)$ is **undefined** for $x = 0$ and $x < 0$. \n",
    "\n",
    "If your dataset contains zeros (e.g., \"Revenue\" where some days are \\$0), we use the **Log1p** transformation:\n",
    "$$y = \\ln(1 + x)$$\n",
    "* This ensures that when $x=0$, $y=\\ln(1)=0$. It keeps your zeros as zeros while transforming the rest of the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Real-World Use Case: Income Distribution\n",
    "Income is almost always right-skewed. A few billionaires create a massive tail that makes the \"Mean\" unrepresentative.\n",
    "* **Original Scale:** The difference between \\$50k and \\$100k feels smaller than the difference between \\$1M and \\$1.05M.\n",
    "* **Log Scale:** The transformer recognizes that a \"doubling\" of income (50 to 100) is the same relative change regardless of the starting point.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",

    "### 5. 🐍 Python Implementation\n",
    "\n",
    "There are three main ways to apply a log transform in Python:\n",

    "1. **Negative Data:** Logarithms of negative numbers are not real numbers. Use the **Yeo-Johnson** transformation instead.\n",
